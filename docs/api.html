			<h1>API reference</h1>

			<h2>GET /v1/polyfill<var>:minify</var>.<var>:type</var></h2>

			<p>Fetch a polyfill bundle.</p>

			<table class='apidoc'>
				<tr>
					<th>Param</th><th>Where</th><th>Description</th>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>minify</code></td>
					<td>URL</td>
					<td>
						Whether to minify the result.  If omitted, output will include the full polyfill source, and a header comment with debug information about the user agent and which polyfills have been included in the bundle.  If set to <code>.min</code>, the output will be minified.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>type</code></td>
					<td>URL</td>
					<td>
						Set to <code>js</code>.  Currently we only support JavaScript polyfills, but the <code>css</code> type is reserved for future use.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>features</code></td>
					<td>Querystring</td>
					<td>
						<p>List of browser features to polyfill. Accepts a comma-separated list of feature names.  Available feature names are shown on the <a href='/v1/docs/features/'>Browsers and Features</a> page, though group aliases such as 'es5' and 'es6' are also accepted (these are defined in the polyfills' config.json files - [here's an example](https://github.com/Financial-Times/polyfill-service/blob/master/polyfills/Array.from/config.json)).</p>
						<p>Each feature name may optionally be appended with zero or more of the following flags:</p>
						<dl>
							<dt><code>|always</code></dt>
							<dd>Polyfill should be included regardless of whether it is required by the user-agent making the request.  If there are multiple browser-specific variants of the polyfill, the default one will be used for browser that doesn't actually require the polyfill.  In some cases where the only way of implementing a polyfill is to use browser-specific proprietary technology, the default variant may be empty.</dd>
							<dt><code>|gated</code></dt>
							<dd>If the polyfill is included in the bundle, it will be accompanied by a feature detect, which will only execute the polyfill if the native API is not present.</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>Omitting or setting to an empty string is equivalent to the value "default", which is an alias for a curated list of the most popular polyfills.</p>
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>flags</code></td>
					<td>Querystring</td>
					<td><p>Comma separated list of flags to apply to <strong>all</strong> features.  For available options see the list in the <code>features</code> parameter documented above.  Equivalent to adding <code>|<em>flagname</em></code> to every feature in the <code>features</code> argument.</p><p>For example, <code>&amp;flags=always,gated</code> will apply both the <code>always</code> and the <code>gated</code> flag to all features requested in the <code>features</code> parameter.</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>ua</code></td>
					<td>Querystring</td>
					<td>
						<p>User agent string to override the <code>User-Agent</code> header on the request.  Useful if the polyfill service is being used from the server-side, and in that scenerio, this is preferable to setting a inaccurate <code>User-Agent</code> header (the User-Agent header should properly be set to a string identifying the client you are using to make the request - for server side requests that might be cURL, for example).</p>
						<p>Normally, responses from the service will Vary on User-Agent. Setting the <code>ua</code> parameter means responses no longer differ between user agents, so the <code>Vary</code> header will not list User-Agent as a vary value.</p>
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td><code>callback</code></td>
					<td>Querystring</td>
					<td>Name of JavaScript function to call after polyfills are loaded.  Must match the PCRE expression <code>^[\w\.]+$</code> otherwise will have no effect.  Note that this feature differs from normal JSONp in that nothing is passed to the function - it is simply a way of triggering your own code when the polyfills have loaded, intended to allow the polyfill service to be more easily loaded asyncronously with <code>async</code> and <code>defer</code> attributes.</td>
