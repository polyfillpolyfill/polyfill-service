	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>
		The Financial Times Limited (“<strong>FT</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”) is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users.
	</p>
	<p>
		We treat personal information in accordance with the following principles:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We will be transparent with users about the types of information we are collecting and what we are allowed to use it for.</li>
		<li>We will not use the information we collect for other purposes without permission or notification (unless we have a lawful basis or are legally required to do so).</li>
		<li>We will use appropriate technical and organisational measures to secure the information that we collect.</li>
		<li>We will respect our users’ rights to privacy, including the right not to receive marketing from us.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy applies to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the Polyfill.io website (“<strong>Site</strong>”); and/or</li>
		<li>the public instance of the Polyfill Service made available by us, as described on the Site (“<strong>Service</strong>”):</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This Site and the Service are referred to together as “<strong>Polyfill.io</strong>”.
	</p>
	<p>
		We collect and use information in different ways for the Site and the Service. This Privacy Policy sets out details of these different ways in which we collect and use information.
	</p>


	<h3 id="what-information-do-we-collect-from-the-service">What information do we collect from the Service?</h3>
	<p>
		The Service is a hosted instance of software known as Polyfill Service. Polyfill Service provides snippets of code, called “polyfills”, that allows websites operated by FT and by others to provide a consistent experience across different browsers. When you load a web page which uses Polyfill Service, your browser will download any polyfills required in order to present the web page successfully in your browser.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to provide the polyfills, the Service receives from your browser certain technical information including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>browser details;</li>
		<li>connection details (such as your IP address which can identify your approximate location and/or name of your ISP);</li>
		<li>the URL of the web page which has made the request to the Service.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We use that information to determine which polyfills are required by your browser. We then retain only the following information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the domain of the web page which has made the request to the Service;</li>
		<li>the user agent string for your browser;</li>
		<li>the set of polyfills that were requested by the web page.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The information we retain cannot identify you. We retain it in order to identify which websites are using the Service and whether any websites are abusing the Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		The website which uses the polyfills is not subject to this privacy policy. We are not responsible for third party websites’ content, use of personal information, or security practices.
	</p>
