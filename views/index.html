				There are lots of differing browsers and browser versions in use throughout the world, each one has a slighly
				different set of features to the rest. This can make developing for browsers a difficult task. The latest
				versions of the popular browsers can do lots of things which older browsers can not – but you may still have
				to support the older browsers. Polyfill.io makes it simpler to support differing browsers by attempting to
				recreate the missing features with polyfills: You can make use of the latest and greatest features in browsers
				which support them, and in those that do not.
